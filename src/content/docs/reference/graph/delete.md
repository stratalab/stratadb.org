title: "Delete graph"
description: "Delete a graph and its visible data."
source: strata-core@1.0.0
section: graph
---

Deletes a named graph and every visible node, edge, binding, and ontology row it owns. Deleting a graph that does not exist is not an error: the acknowledgement reports `deleted: false` with a `not_found` effect. Earlier states remain readable through time travel on other commands.

Successful mutations return an acknowledgement that identifies the affected target, the mutation effect, and commit facts when the operation changed stored state.

## Examples

Delete a graph.

### CLI

```console
$ strata graph create temp
$ strata graph delete temp
$ strata graph list
```

### Wire

```json
{"graph":"temp","type":"graph_create"}
{"graph":"temp","type":"graph_delete"}
{"type":"graph_list"}
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `graph` | `string` | yes | Graph name. |

Plus the optional scope: `branch` and `space` (default to the session branch and the `"default"` space).

## Returns

`MutationAck<GraphDelete>`.
