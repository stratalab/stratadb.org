title: "Apply graph delete policy"
description: "Apply a delete policy to bound graph facts."
source: strata-core@1.0.0
section: graph
---

Applies an explicit policy to every graph node bound to the given entity target: `cascade` deletes the bound nodes and their incident edges, `detach` keeps the nodes but removes their bindings, and `keep_dangling` preserves the bindings so traversal can report the target's status. The acknowledgement reports how many bound nodes the policy covered.

Successful mutations return an acknowledgement that identifies the affected target, the mutation effect, and commit facts when the operation changed stored state.

## Examples

Cascade-delete graph facts bound to an entity.

### CLI

```console
$ strata graph create kb
$ strata graph add-node kb ada --binding {"target":{"key":"user:1","primitive":"kv","space":"default"}}
$ strata command run --command-json '{"policy":"cascade","target":{"key":"user:1","primitive":"kv","space":"default"},"type":"graph_apply_delete_policy"}'  # cascade removes the bound node and its incident edges.
$ strata graph get-node kb ada
```

### Wire

```json
{"graph":"kb","type":"graph_create"}
{"binding":{"target":{"key":"user:1","primitive":"kv","space":"default"}},"graph":"kb","node_id":"ada","type":"graph_add_node"}
{"policy":"cascade","target":{"key":"user:1","primitive":"kv","space":"default"},"type":"graph_apply_delete_policy"}
{"graph":"kb","node_id":"ada","type":"graph_get_node"}
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `policy` | `GraphDeletePolicy` | yes | Policy to apply: `cascade`, `detach`, or `keep_dangling`. |
| `target` | `GraphBindingTarget` | yes | The bound entity target. |

Plus the optional scope: `branch` and `space` (default to the session branch and the `"default"` space).

## Returns

`MutationAck<GraphDeletePolicyApply>`.
