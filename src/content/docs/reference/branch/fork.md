title: "Fork branch from current head"
description: "Fork a new branch from the current head of a source branch."
source: strata-core@1.0.0
section: branch
---

Forks a new branch from the source branch's current head. The new branch sees all data visible on the source at fork time; later writes on either branch stay isolated. The returned branch summary records the parent name, fork version, and generation.

On the CLI, all three fork commands share the single verb `strata branch fork <SOURCE> <BRANCH>`: with no flags it runs this command, while `--version` routes to `branch.fork_at_version` and `--timestamp` routes to `branch.fork_at_timestamp` (both wire-surface commands).

Successful mutations return an acknowledgement that identifies the affected target, the mutation effect, and commit facts when the operation changed stored state.

## Examples

Fork a branch from another branch's head.

### CLI

```console
$ strata branch fork default experiment
$ strata branch list
```

### Wire

```json
{"branch":"experiment","source":"default","type":"branch_fork_current"}
{"type":"branch_list"}
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source` | `string` | yes | Source branch name. |

Plus the optional scope: `branch` and `space` (default to the session branch and the `"default"` space).

## Returns

`MutationAck<BranchItem>`.
