title: "Compare branches"
description: "Compare two branches and report the entities that differ across every primitive."
source: strata-core@1.1.0
section: branch
---

Compares two branches and reports the authored entities that differ, grouped by
capability and space: entries `added` on `branch_b`, `removed` relative to
`branch_a`, and `modified` on both sides. The comparison is directional from
`branch_a` to `branch_b`.

Every data primitive is compared — key-value, JSON documents, vectors, event
streams, and graphs. Graph changes are reported per row class: nodes, edges, and
ontology appear as separate capabilities in the result. Derived rows (search and
vector indexes, graph reverse maps) are omitted. A missing branch is rejected
with `not_found.engine.branch`.

Status commands return a scalar or compact status payload and do not mutate database state.

## Examples

Compare a fork against the branch it came from, across primitives.

### CLI

```console
$ strata vector collection create notes 2 cosine
$ strata kv put config base
$ strata branch fork default experiment
$ strata kv put config tuned --branch experiment  # diverge the key-value entry on the fork
$ strata vector upsert notes n1 [0.1,0.2] --branch experiment  # add a vector on the fork
$ strata branch diff default experiment  # reports the key-value change and the new vector, grouped by capability
```

### Wire

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `at_timestamp` | `integer` | no | Optional timestamp in microseconds; compare each branch as of it. |
| `branch_a` | `string` | yes | The first branch (the `A` side). |
| `branch_b` | `string` | yes | The second branch (the `B` side). |

## Returns

`StatusResponse<BranchComparisonItem>`.
