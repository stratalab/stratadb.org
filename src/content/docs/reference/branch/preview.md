title: "Preview branch promotion"
description: "Preview promoting one branch into another, reporting conflicts without mutating either branch."
source: strata-core@1.1.0
section: branch
---

Previews promoting the `source` branch into the `target` branch: it derives the
branch point from the recorded fork lineage, runs a three-way comparison, and
reports the conflicts a promotion would hit — entries both branches changed
differently since the branch point. Preview is read-only: it mutates neither
branch.

Each conflict reports what the selected `strategy` would do — `strict` refuses
(`refused`), `source_wins` overwrites the target with the source value. A preview
with no conflicts is clean and a promotion under `strict` would apply. Preview
covers the capabilities a promotion applies — key-value, JSON, and vectors;
events and graphs are diff-only and never appear as promotion conflicts.
Branches with no shared fork lineage are rejected with
`invalid_argument.engine.branch_point`.

Status commands return a scalar or compact status payload and do not mutate database state.

## Examples

Preview promoting a fork into the branch it came from.

### CLI

```console
$ strata kv put config base
$ strata branch fork default experiment
$ strata kv put config tuned --branch experiment  # change on the fork
$ strata branch preview experiment default --strategy strict  # a clean preview — no conflicting changes on default
```

### Wire

```json

```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |

| `strategy` | `PromotionStrategy` | no | Conflict-resolution strategy to evaluate the preview under. |
| `target` | `string` | yes | The branch that would receive the promotion. |

## Returns

`StatusResponse<BranchPreviewItem>`.
