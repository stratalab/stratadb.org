description: "Report capabilities for a model spec."

Parses a model spec into a provider and model name and reports what that combination supports without running the model. The result states whether generation, tokenization, embedding, and ranking are available, whether the operation requires network access or an API key, whether this binary was compiled with the provider feature needed to execute, whether the runtime currently permits network calls, and the known embedding dimension. Model specs are catalog names (`tinyllama`), catalog `name:quant` pairs (`tinyllama:q8_0`), local GGUF paths, or provider specs (`anthropic:claude-...`).

## Examples

Report a model's capabilities without a network call.

### CLI

```console
$ strata inference capability openai:gpt-4o-mini  # Pure metadata — no request is sent to the provider.
```

### Wire

```json
{"model":"openai:gpt-4o-mini","type":"inference_model_capability"}
```
